 Project Scenario:

Create a code that can be used to compile the list of the top 10 largest banks in the world ranked by market capitalization in billion USD. 
Further, the data needs to be transformed and stored in GBP, EUR, and INR as well, by the exchange rate information that has been made available to you as a CSV file. 
The processed information table is to be saved locally in a CSV format and as a database table.

My job is to create an automated system to generate this information so that the same can be executed in every financial quarter to prepare the report.
